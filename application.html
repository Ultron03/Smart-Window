             <h3>Popular Applications of Smart Glass</h3>
             <p>The applications for PDLC switchable smart glass and smart film are virtually endless and limited only by your imagination. Here are just a few examples
              <ul>
                <li>Privacy windows for the home and office</li>
                <li>Room partitions / Dividers</li>
                <li>Solar control / Security panels</li>
                <li>Electronic curtains / Blinds</li>
                <li>Skylights / Vision panels</li>
                <li>Conservatory roofs / Window panels</li>
                <li>Counters / Display cases</li>
                <li>Window displays / Advertising screens</li></ul></p>
            <h3> How much are ‘Smart Windows?</h3>
            <p> This is perhaps one of the more complex questions we are asked by customers, especially when they do not fully understand their own requirements in context of what is offered. The difference in cost between the potential Switchable Smart Glass options are vast, with various products to choose from that fall under the ‘Smart Window’ category, so it is of critical importance that customers work with the Intelligent Glass sales team to figure out the best option for them.</p>
            <h3><li>Smart Windows in Doors</li></h3>
            <p>Ranking as one of the least expensive products would be Switchable Smart Glass Vision Panels from Intelligent Glass. These window options are incredibly popular mainly for their effectiveness and obtainability both in terms of price and installation. Smart Glass Vision Panels make use of the space for glass window vision panels often seen on interior doors in environments such as offices, hospitals, schools and banks. Our PDLC product turns a seemingly innocuous door window panel into a privacy marvel, building the power and electrical components that operate it in the door itself, with minimal cabling and disruption. Push button operated, this small window allows the occupants to benefit from privacy without being disrupted by someone entering the room to check if it is occupied, enabling those wanting to enter to simply press the button and discreetly look into the room without interrupting the occupants.</p>
            <p>Whilst on the surface, this product is ranked as one of the least expensive Smart Glass products, there is an issue in the way of comparing it to other products. Smart Glass Vision Panels are built for a specific purpose that fulfils specific requirements, so to draw comparison with, for example, a Double Glazed Smart Glass window, could be misleading due to the differences in their functional properties. However, this could be argued as just the very reason that these products need such an assessment. Understanding not only the comparative cost of these products but also their applications, functional differences and specification strengths is an integral part of making sure you have the correct product for your   project.</p>

            <h3><li>External Smart Windows</li></h3>
              <p>Double Glazed Smart Glass Windows (or Smart Glass DGUs) are potentially one of the more expensive Smart Window options, with a complex manufacturing process required to produce it. The PDLC layer encased inside the unit is fully protected from outside threats such as weather, moisture or physical damage. As one of the most protected Switchable Glass window options, this product offers all the benefits of a standard DGU, such as increased insulation and UV protection, along with the benefits of Switchable Glass and truly demonstrates the risks of comparing Smart Glass products on price alone. Smart Glass windows made from double glazing offer far more benefits that are appropriate for an external window application than, for example, Toughened Switchable Glass, which, as standard, would not offer any UV protection or insulation that would likely be necessary for an external window. Whilst Toughened Switchable Glass would be the cheaper option, it would not be appropriate for this window application.Due to the overwhelming benefits seen with Smart Glass DGUs, the window applications it can be used for are immense, including but not limited to External Smart Glass Windows, Smart Glass Bi-Fold Doors and even Smart Glass Skylights. In fact, most external window applications can accommodate Smart Glass DGUs to their benefit as the most appropriate Smart Glass product for the application.</p>

              <h3><li>Safety Glass Smart Windows</li></h3>
                <p>Laminate Switchable Smart Glass serves as a compromise between the ultimate protection seen from Smart Glass DGUs and the cost-effective solution of Toughened Switchable Glass, bringing different advantages and benefits. With Laminate Smart Glass, the PDLC layer is skilfully bonded and encased inside 2 sheets of laminated safety glass, helping it meet safety regulations in applications where this a concern as well as keeping it fully protected from threats such as moisture and physical damage. Cheaper than Smart Glass Double Glazing but more expensive than Toughened Smart Glass, Laminate Smart Glass is a great internal window solution for high traffic public areas or spaces that demand Health & Safety considerations, as by using safety glass, this product is compliant for such applications. Its use in wet room or shower environments also demonstrates its versatility, allowing Laminate Smart Glass to be used as internal dividing bathroom windows, partitions or even shower privacy screens, thanks to its moisture protection.</p>
                <p>The PDLC layer protection makes it extremely easy to maintain, allowing you to clean it as you would any other glass and making it perfect for applications involving children, healthcare, or any situation where a high level of cleanliness is not only important but difficult to achieve. Laminate Switchable Smart Glass also offers other advantages over Toughened Switchable Glass, specifically its sound insulating properties, which naturally aren’t as good as DGUs, but due to composition of Laminate Smart Glass, are far superior to the sound insulating properties of Toughened Smart Glass; a significant advantage for a privacy product.Despite these glowing specifications, one must think very carefully about whether Laminate Smart Glass is an appropriate solution, especially should projection be a requirement, as the additional processes required to make Laminate Smart Glass projection capable are more involved than those required for Toughened Smart Glass, coming in with a higher price tag and representing the significant differences in these Smart Glass window options.</p>
